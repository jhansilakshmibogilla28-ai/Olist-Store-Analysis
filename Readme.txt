Olist Store Analysis is an advanced data analytics project designed to uncover deep insights from the Olist E-commerce dataset by applying structured analytical and visualization techniques. The project emphasizes transforming raw transactional data into meaningful business intelligence that can guide operational and strategic decisions. By combining multiple relational datasets, the analysis delivers a complete understanding of the interactions between customers, sellers, products, payments, and logistics within a large-scale online marketplace.

The project begins with extensive data preprocessing, including data validation, removal of inconsistencies, handling of missing and duplicate values, and normalization of attributes to improve analytical accuracy. Feature engineering techniques are applied to derive new metrics such as delivery delays, customer lifetime behavior indicators, and seller performance measures. These engineered features enhance the depth of analysis and enable more precise insight generation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a central role in this project, where statistical summaries and visualizations are used to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies across sales volume, revenue growth, order frequency, and product demand. Regional analysis highlights geographic variations in customer behavior and delivery performance, while category-level insights reveal high-performing and underperforming products. Visualization tools are used to clearly communicate findings and support data-driven storytelling.

Furthermore, the project analyzes logistics and fulfillment efficiency by examining order processing times, shipping durations, and delivery delays, along with their direct impact on customer satisfaction scores. Customer reviews and ratings are evaluated to understand service quality and to identify factors influencing positive and negative customer experiences. The insights generated from this analysis can help improve supply chain efficiency, enhance customer experience, and optimize seller performance.

Overall, this project demonstrates strong expertise in data analytics, business intelligence, and real-world problem solving. It showcases the ability to work with complex datasets, derive actionable insights, and present findings in a clear and meaningful way, making it highly relevant for roles in data analysis, business analysis, and decision support systems.
